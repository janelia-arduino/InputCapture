  Use InputCapture to execute a function once per period of a square
  wave applied to the input capture pin. The duration of the period (in
  units of microseconds) and the on_duration (in units of microseconds)
  are automatically sent to the user function as
  parameters. InputCapture is capable of measuring frequencies from less
  than 1Hz up to approximately 7kHz. For now, InputCapture is hard coded
  to use Timer5, so it works with the Arduino Mega.

* Execute Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) Function Once Per Period

  #+BEGIN_SRC C++
void userFunc(unsigned long period_us, unsigned long on_duration_us)
{
  //your code here
}
void setup()
{
  input_capture.init();
  input_capture.addCycleTask(userFunc);
}
  #+END_SRC
